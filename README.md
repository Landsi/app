# [wwdc.family](https://wwdc.family)

This is an experiment to use Firebase and React Native to build a [wwdc.family](https://wwdc.family) app. 

Don't use that source code as reference - I have no prior experience with JavaScript, React, nor React Native. 

All feedback welcome of course, feel free to submit a PR too üëç
