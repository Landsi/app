# wwdc.family

This is an experiment to use Firebase and React Native to build a [wwdc.family](https://wwdc.family) app. 

Don't use that source code as reference - I have no prior experience with JavaScript, React, nor React Native. 

All feedback welcome of course, feel free to submit a PR too üëç

## Setup locally

```
git clone https://github.com/wwdc-family/app
cd app
brew update && brew install node watchman
npm install
react-native run-ios
```
