**Important:** You'll have to login again, sorry about that.

While trying to migrate to Google Maps I revoked the API key, rendering the old builds broken. The new release was supposed to fix the problem, however the auth library I use for React Native had a bug, that it would crash when the cached session wasn't valid. I submitted a PR (https://github.com/fullstackreact/react-native-firestack/pull/340) to fix the library I'm using.

This build includes the following changes:

- Fix crash on startup that happened due to caching of user session with a revoked API token, sorry about that
- Update Firebase API token
- Enable image caching for Twitter avatars
- Reduced startup time from 10 seconds to about 1 second
- Improve fastlane setup
